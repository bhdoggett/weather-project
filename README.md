## Weather Project

This project has been created by a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

If you have any questions about this project or the program in general, visit [parsity.io](https://parsity.io/) or email hello@parsity.io.

This is a simple weather application which will display the current weather and a five-day forecast for any geographic location based on an input of City, State (if applicable) and Country. The application will begin with the user's current location as a default.

Data is taken from Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api.
